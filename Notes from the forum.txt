input istruction: 
# no need to validate input since 2.7.12 says that the input is valid 
# input file will *not* have an empty line at the end (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=161522)
# point array will have max of 50 points and not 1000
# each cordination in point as input will be with max 4 digits dot max of 4 digits like: 1234.1234 (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159898)
# file will not be empty ()
# input and output for each goal! (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159899)

print instruction: 
# printing output will *not* have an empty line at the end (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=161522)
# printing double: 
    1. minus zero (-0.0000 -> 0.0000) (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162051)
    2. round 4 digit up (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162710)
# print spk - print k indexes of the first centroid *only at python not at C" 

Yacobi instruction:
# *calc yacobi on matrix given as input and not on lnorm!*
# set EPSILON for yacobi to be 1.0e-15 - still relevant? 
# pivot step - if there are 2 maxvalues chose the one with the lower index (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159570, https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162299)
# print yacobi: 
    1. https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=157582 - first line eigen values, than eigen vectors as rows *not sorted, as we found them*, the sort is relevent only for spk
    also see https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159570 Alon Harel comment regarding sorting operation
    2. https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159609 - eigen vector from matrix as col
# [*no answer*] size of input for yacobi - (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162954)

Termination instruction: 
# for errors that are not "Invalid input" (won't be since 2.7.12) print "An Error Has Occured"
    we should add exit if got failure for example memory error (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159574) and Python-C API (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=160194)
# keep the mistake in the print (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162426) - Occured instead of Occurred.
# we can terminate any way we want (assert / exit / return) so far we print the right error (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=160062)
