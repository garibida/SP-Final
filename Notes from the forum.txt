input istruction: 
# [V] - no need to validate input since 2.7.12 says that the input is valid 
# [V] - input file will *not* have an empty line at the end (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=161522)
# [V] - point array will have max of 50 points and not 1000
# [V] - delete tests with more that 50 points - only test8 of Ron has more than 50 points
# [V] - each cordination in point as input will be with max 4 digits dot max of 4 digits like: 1234.1234 (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159898)
# [V] - file will not be empty
# [V] - input and output for each goal! (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159899)
# [ ] - input will have at least 2 points, Ron's test rub 3 points, we should make sure that 2 points is working fine (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=163230)

print instruction: 
# [V] - printing output will *not* have an empty line at the end (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=161522)
# printing double: 
    1. [V] - minus zero (-0.0000 -> 0.0000) (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162051)
    2. [V] - round 4 digit up or cut? cut! (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162710)
# [V] - print spk - print k indexes of the first centroid *only at python not at C" 

Yacobi instruction:
# [V] - *calc yacobi on matrix given as input and not on lnorm!*
# [V] - set EPSILON for yacobi to be 1.0e-15 - still relevant? 
# [V] - pivot step - if there are 2 maxvalues chose the one with the lower index (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159570, https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162299)
# [V] - print yacobi:
    1. https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=157582 - first line eigen values, than eigen vectors as rows *not sorted, as we found them*, the sort is relevent only for spk
    also see https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159570 Alon Harel comment regarding sorting operation
    2. https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159609 - eigen vector from matrix as col
# [ ] - [*no answer*] size of input for yacobi - (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162954)

Termination instruction: 
# [V] - for errors that are not "Invalid input" (won't be since 2.7.12) print "An Error Has Occured"
    we should add exit if got failure for example memory error (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=159574) and Python-C API (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=160194)
# [V] - keep the mistake in the print (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162426) - Occured instead of Occurred.
# [V] - we can terminate any way we want (assert / exit / return) so far we print the right error (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=160062)

other instructions: 
# [V] - Separation the project to number of file is allowed (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=156940)
# [V] - 2 equel rows in T matrix or a row of zeros in U matrix won't be in the test (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=163019)
# [ ] - Cluster clastaring use case (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162884)
# [ ] - [*no answer*] calc of Matrix V and A-Atag - after stop which phase do we take (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162730)

TODO: 
# [V] - print and compare mid result of test 1 of Ron's tester // no need, invalid input (2 rows are the same)
# go over use cases for tester and see if there is something to add:
    [ ] - add to Ron's test input of 1 and 2 points and compare
    [ ] - add to Ron's test runtime and compare with others
    [ ] - add to Ron's test Rami's example

# check input use cases:
    [V] - negtive k
    [V] - k >= number of points
    [V] - k = 0, k = 1
    [V] - goal not sported
    [V] - change order of args 
    [V] - invalid path for file
# [ ] - Run on Nova
